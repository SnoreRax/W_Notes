# Solutions

## Problem 1

Just do _nmap_ scan, here's what I used:

```
nmap -sCV -A -T4 [IP Address]
```

**Results:**

## Problem 2

For this, do _fuzzing_, here's what I used:

```
gobuster dir -u http://[IP Address]:80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,html
```

Do note you can use other wordlists, and the extensions aren't necessary for this particular room. Just a habit of mine to make sure I see everything.

**Results:**

**Answer: development**

## Problem 3

For this one, just use _enum4linux_ to find the local SMB users.

Should look like this:

Also, there's a lot more displayed than that, but I'm not showing the full report lmao.

## Problem 4

Refer to [Problem 3](#problem-3).

## Problem 5

Use _hydra_, here's what I did:

```
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://[IP Address]
```

**Results:**

## Problem 6

You should know this one by this point lol, but just in case...

**Answer: SSH**

## Problem 7

Well for this one, you can either scout around the file system manually like I did, or use _linpeas_ like what **John Hammond** did.

Anyways, here's a screenshot of me doing that:

## Problem 8

Again, refer to [Problem 3](#problem-3).

But at this point, you should be able to see it too after moving around a bit on _ssh_.

## Problem 9

Well...

Time for privilege escalation.

Here's how it goes:

1. Grab id_rsa file (copy/paste, transfer via SCP or NetCat)

2. Convert to a file format that john can read `ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.txt`

3. Brute-force it to get the password:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bd9fe39-a496-486b-a993-8701bdf809f2)

4. Change permissions so that only the file owner can use it (for ssh) `chmod 600 id_rsa`

5. Use the private key to access user _kay_ `ssh -i id_rsa kay@[IP Address]`

6. Use the passphrase you got from _john_ for the ssh login: **beeswax**

## Problem 10

Just cat the file:

**Alternatively**, you could apparently just _vim_ the file as user _jan_, which I did not know about until recently.
