# Git-dumper Usage

In the event that you are able to find a **.git** directory, you can use ```git-dumper``` to grab the entire repository so that you may inspect it yourself freely.

**Command:**

```
git-dumper http://[site]/.git [DIR]
```

**Do Note:** ```[DIR]``` refers to where it'll be stored on your machine. I learned that the hard way lmao.

Refer to [**Dog**](../../HTB/Dog/Writeup.md#task-4) for the practical use-case scenario.
